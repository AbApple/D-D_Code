## D&D_Code
This program sorts a collection of DND characters by skill level. The result depends on the skill the user inputs. Skill options are: Strength, Dexterity, Consitution, Wisdom, Charisma, and Intelligence. To exit the program, enter "recursion!"
The program is structured to initialize all character data by reading from charList.txt in the specific format of the file. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
App.java contains main method program 
charList.txt contains all DND characters, their skills, and their levels.
